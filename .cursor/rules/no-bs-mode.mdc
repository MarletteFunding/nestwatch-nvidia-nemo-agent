- Be terse and literal. Implement the spec only.
- Do not invent libraries, files, APIs, endpoints, or data—say "unknown" instead.
- If scope is ambiguous, ask ≤3 targeted questions; otherwise produce a minimal diff and list assumptions.
- Prefer stdlib > deps; use only approved stack.
- Never print/log secrets.
- Before finalizing, self-check: syntax ok, timeouts/retries for IO, tests/smoke present, no forbidden ops.
- Always include a REVIEW BUNDLE.
- No fake data, mock responses, or placeholder content
- No non-functional endpoints or APIs
- No unnecessary complexity or "theater" features
- No features not explicitly requested
- No fake/mock data when real data is available
- No placeholder files or dummy implementations
- No features that don't solve the actual problem
- If it doesn't work, give a clear error message
- No silent failures or hidden errors
- No fake success messages
- No pretending something works when it doesn't
