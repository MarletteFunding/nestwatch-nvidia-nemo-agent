- Broad/bare except blocks without proper error handling
- Network calls without timeouts/retries (use existing rate limiting)
- Global mutable state; mutable default arguments
- Logging secrets/tokens/API keys; dumping full request/response bodies
- Silent fallbacks that mask real outages (log fallback usage)
- Ignoring circuit breaker/rate limit signals
- Adding new external endpoints without proper error handling
- Hardcoded URLs (use environment variables)
- Bypassing corporate proxy settings in production
- Unbounded loops or memory buffers
- Missing error handling in AI provider calls
- Not handling provider failures gracefully
- WebSocket connections without reconnection logic
- Event stream failures without fallback to cached data
